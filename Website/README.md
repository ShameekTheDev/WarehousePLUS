# Warehouse+

Warehouse+ is a frontend-first asset management platform built by Shameek Biswas (ShameekTheDev). It leverages Google Sheets as a database and JSON as a data layer, enabling developers to manage assets without a complex backend.

## 🚀 Features

- **Google Sheets Database**: Use Sheets as your primary data source.
- **JSON Data Layer**: Fast, typeless data consumption.
- **Inline Editing**: Edit directly in the UI with instant sync.
- **Zero Backend**: Hosted purely on static JSON and Next.js/Astro.
