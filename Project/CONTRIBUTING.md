# Contributing to Warehouse+

First off — thanks for wanting to contribute 💙  
Warehouse+ is an experimental, no-backend CDN-style system powered by Google Sheets + JSON + Next.js.  
Every contribution helps push this idea further.

## 🚀 What is Warehouse+?

Warehouse+ uses:
- **Google Sheets** as a structured database
- **JSON files** as a sync layer
- **Next.js** as the frontend
- Zero traditional backend

Think of it as a *lightweight private CDN + asset manager*.
